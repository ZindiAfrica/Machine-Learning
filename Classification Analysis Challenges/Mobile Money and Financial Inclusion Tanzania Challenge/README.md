# Competition Summary

## Description

Only 16.7% of the population in Tanzania has a bank account.

But an additional 48.6% of Tanzanians who donâ€™t have a bank account do have other types of formal financial services, primarily mobile money.

For people who have been traditionally excluded from the formal financial system in Africa and other developing markets, mobile money has become an important entry point to financial inclusion.

It is increasingly becoming a platform for people to access a broad range of financial services, including savings, credit, and insurance.

The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to use mobile money and other financial services (savings, credit, and insurance).



## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Datasets provided for this competition were used.

Features were also extracted from the contextual layers data accessed from the Africa GeoPortal.

Data was extracted from the FSDT Finscope 2017 survey and prepared specifically for this challenge.

The main dataset contained demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 10,000 individuals across Tanzania.

Dataset about the geospatial mapping of all cash outlets in Tanzania in 2012 was used.

This data was collected by FSDT.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The error metric for this competition is the Log Loss.

## Prizes

1st Place: $750 USD + a 1 Year license for ArcGIS (a value of $250 USD)

2nd Place: $500 USD + a 1 Year license for ArcGIS (a value of $250 USD)

3rd Place: $250 USD + a 1 Year license for ArcGIS (a value of $250 USD)

Each of the top 3 winners will receive a 1 Year license

## Benefits

These models can help mobile money providers target new clients and markets across Tanzania more effectively.

It could also help financial services providers cross-sell other financial services (savings, credit, and insurance) to the existing mobile money customer base.
