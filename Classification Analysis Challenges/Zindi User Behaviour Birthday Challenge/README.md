# Competition Summary

## Description

Our user community is the most important part of the Zindi platform. 

An active user is one that enters a competition, makes a submission or engages through the discussion forums.

The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to determine if a user will be active on Zindi in the next month. 


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data is a subset of Zindi user activity. All variables have been masked to preserve privacy.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes

1st place: $1 500

2nd place: $900

3rd place: $600


## Benefits

These solutions will help us establish and track our performance as a data science community and platform, and make sure that we are best serving the needs of you, our users.
