# Competition Summary

## Description

From measles to the common flu, vaccines have lowered the risk of illness and death, and have saved countless lives around the world.

Unfortunately in some countries, the 'anti-vaxxer' movement lowered the rates of vaccination and new outbreaks of old diseases.

The anti-vaccination sentiment could pose a serious threat to the global efforts to get COVID-19 under control in the long term.

The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is positive, neutral, or negative.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition were used.

The data comes from tweets collected and classified through Crowdbreaks.org.

Tweets have been classified as pro-vaccine (1), neutral (0) or anti-vaccine (-1).

The tweets have had usernames and web addresses removed.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The error metric for this competition is the Root Mean Squared Error.

## Prizes

1st: $125

2nd: $100

3rd: $75

Top 10 will also receive access to valuable online data science learning content for approximately six months.


## Benefits

The solutions could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.
