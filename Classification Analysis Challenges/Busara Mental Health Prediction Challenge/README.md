# Competition Summary

## Description

The World Health Organization estimates that 1.3 million Kenyans suffer from untreated major depressive disorder (MDD; commonly known as depression) every year.

Mental health treatment in Kenya suffers from a lack of resources and stigmatization. There are only two certified psychiatrists per million people in Kenya.

Few facilities exist outside of urban areas and people are unlikely to know about or access them.

The Busara Center for Behavioral Economics decided to challenge the data science community in Nairobi, across Africa, and around the world to predict depression cases from routine survey data.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

These data came from a 2015 study conducted by the Busara Center in rural Siaya County, near Lake Victoria in western Kenya.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The error metric used was be the percentage of survey respondents for whom they predicted the 'depressed' variable incorrectly.

## Prizes

The top 10 submissions will earn up to 500 Zindi Points.

## Benefits

A model which accurately predicts which individuals are likely to be depressed from the survey data could be used by mental health providers such as local clinics, NGOs or community health volunteers to reach out to those at risk.
