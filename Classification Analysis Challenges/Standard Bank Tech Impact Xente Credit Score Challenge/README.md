# Competition Summary

## Description

This challenge is an invitational challenge designed in association with Standard Bank, specifically for the Standard Bank Tech Impact Challenge (SBTIC) Finals.

Xente is a Ugandan e-commerce startup that makes it easy for consumers to make payments, get loans, and shop using simply a mobile phone.

According to the Uganda FinScope 2018 survey findings, 46% (8.5 million) adults borrowed money during the 12-month period prior to the survey, with the majority borrowing to cover regular living expenses (such as education) during low-income periods.

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to default on their loans, based on their loan repayment behaviour and ecommerce transaction activity.

This challenge was hosted by Xente, in association with Standard Bank.




## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The dataset included a sample of approximately 2,665 unique e-commerce transactions that occurred between 21 September 2018 and 17 July 2019.

During this period, 1,631 loans were issued to Xente clients.

The data have been split into a test and training set.

The training set contained 1,769 unique transactions and the test set contained 905 unique transactions.



## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this challenge was the Area Under the Curve (AUC).


## Prizes

There were no cash prizes for this challenge.

However, the top 10 submissions earned up to 2000 Zindi Points.
