# Competition Summary

## Description

Gender-based violence, or GBV, is an ongoing and ever-resent scourge around the world, and is particularly prevalent in developing and least-developed countries.

Gender-based violence also increased in many parts of the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the greatest challenges in combating GBV is the ‘culture of silence’, where victims of violence are scared, ashamed or intimidated to discuss their experiences with others and often do not report their experiences to authorities.

Victims may find and safety sharing their experiences online (as evidenced by the #MeToo movement), allowing them to get more support in an anonymous and/or safe way.

The objective of this challenge is create a machine learning algorithm that classifies tweets about GBV into one of five categories: sexual violence, emotional violence, harmful traditional practices, physical violence and economic violence.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data was collected from Twitter using a python library (twint) by Ambassador Lawrence Moruye for the AFD Gender-Based Violence Dataset Collection Challenge.

Pretrained models was allowed as long as they are openly available to everyone.

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this competition is Accuracy.

Keywords was not allowed in solutions.

## Prizes

2000 Zindi Points distributed to users who are placed on the leaderboard.

## Benefits

The solutions can be used to summarise tweets and present evidence to policymakers and law enforcement agencies.

The solutions can derive statistics about when and who made the tweet can be used to find trends while preserving anonymity.
