# Competition Summary

## Description

In recent news articles states that air quality has improved due to COVID-19. In parts of many African cities, air quality seems to be getting worse as more people stay at home.

For this challenge we’ll be digging deeper into the data, finding ways to track air quality and how it is changing, even in places without ground-based sensors.

This information will be especially useful in the face of the current crisis, since poor air quality makes a respiratory disease like COVID-19 more dangerous.

We’ve collected weather data and daily observations from the Sentinel 5P satellite tracking various pollutants in the atmosphere.

The objective of this challenge is to predict PM2.5 particulate matter concentration (a common measure of air quality that normally requires ground-based sensors to measure) every day for each city.

PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and is one of the most harmful air pollutants.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data comes from three main sources:

Ground-based air quality sensors. These measure the target variable (PM2.5 particle concentration).

The Global Forecast System (GFS) for weather data. Humidity, temperature and wind speed, which can be used as inputs for your model.

The Sentinel 5P satellite. This satellite monitors various pollutants in the atmosphere.



## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The Root Mean Squared Error was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes

This is a learning competition.



## Benefits

These solutions will be especially useful in the face of the current crisis, since poor air quality makes a respiratory disease like COVID-19 more dangerous.
