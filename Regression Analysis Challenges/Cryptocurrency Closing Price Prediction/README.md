# Competition Summary

## Description

Building footprints are useful for a range of important applications, from population estimation, urban planning and humanitarian response, to environmental and climate science.

Open Buildings is a dataset of building footprints designed to support applications for social good. 

The objective of this challenge is to propose a solution that demonstrates use of data science to extract useful insights from the Open buildings dataset. 


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

This large-scale open dataset consists of outlines of buildings derived from high-resolution 50 cm satellite imagery.

It contains 516M building detections across an area of 19.4M km2 or 64% of the African continent.

For each building in this dataset, the polygon describing its footprint on the ground, a confidence score indicating how sure we are that this is a building, and a Plus Code corresponding to the centre of the building were included.

External data was allowed, as long as it is shared publicly on the discussion board.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

Submissions were evaluated within 30 working days of the close of the competition by a panel of judges, based on the following criteria:

Potential impact of the solution

Uniqueness of the solution

Reproducibility and generalisability

Overall wow factor
