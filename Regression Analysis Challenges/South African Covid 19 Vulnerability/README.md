# Competition Summary

## Description

The 2011 census gives us valuable information for determining who might be most vulnerable to COVID-19 in South Africa.

However, the data is nearly 10 years old, and we expect that some key indicators will have changed in that time.

Building an up-to-date map showing where the most vulnerable are located will be a key step in responding to the disease.

The task is to predict the percentage of households that fall into a particularly vulnerable bracket - large households who must leave their homes to fetch water - using 2011 South African census data. 


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data sets provided were only used. External data was not allowed.

South Africa is divided into 4,392 wards. 

We aggregated the target indicators (households with 5+ members and no on-premises water) and the other predictive variables from the census across all the households within each ward to create an aggregated value of each indicator per ward.

Some wards are for training, the remainder are the test set.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The Root Mean Squared Error was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes

This is a learning competition.


## Benefits

The Solutions will develop a proof-of-concept for how machine learning can help governments more accurately map COVID-19 risk in 2020 using old data, without requiring a new costly, risky, and time-consuming on-the-ground survey.

The Solutions will show that with machine learning it is possible to use easy-to-measure stats to identify areas most at risk even in years when census data is not collected.
