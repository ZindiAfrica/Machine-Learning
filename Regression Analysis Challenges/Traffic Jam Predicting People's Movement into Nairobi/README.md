# Competition Summary

## Description

Nairobi is one of the most heavily congested cities in Africa. Each day thousands of Kenyans make the trip into Nairobi from towns such as Kisii, Keroka, and beyond for work, business, or to visit friends and family.

The journey can be long, and the final approach into the city can impact the length of the trip significantly depending on traffic.

The aim of the competition is to create a predictive model using traffic data provided from Uber Movement and historic bus ticket sales data from Mobiticket to predict the number of tickets that will be sold for buses into Nairobi from cities in "up country" Kenya.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

The data used to train the model were historic hourly traffic patterns in Nairobi and historic ticket purchasing data for 14 bus routes into Nairobi from October 2017 to April 2018.

It included the place or origin, the scheduled time of departure, the channel used for the purchase, the type of vehicle, the capacity of the vehicle, and the assigned seat number.

Zindi competitors were allowed to create their own customized traffic datasets using the Uber Movement platform.

## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.

## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)

## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.

## Evaluation:

The Mean Absolute Error was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes
1st: $7 000 USD

2nd: $2 000 USD

3rd: $1 000 USD

Uber Movement Prize: $2 000 USD

The Uber Movement Prize was be awarded to the highest-ranking model that uses data extracted from the Uber Movement (movement.uber.com) platform in a "meaningful" way.

## Benefits

The resulting models can be used by Mobiticket and bus operators to anticipate customer demand for certain rides, to manage resources and vehicles more efficiently.

It can also offer promotions and sell other services more effectively, such as micro-insurance, or even improve customer service by being able to send alerts and other useful information to customers.

The solutions to this challenge are the first step towards solving Nairobi's traffic problems.
