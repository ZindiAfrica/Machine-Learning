# Competition Summary

## Description

Female household headship has been on the rise in South Africa in recent years.

Female-headed households, in general, are more vulnerable to lower household incomes and higher rates of poverty.

The South African census collects data on female headship and income levels of every household across the country every 10 years.

This challenge explores how machine learning can help improve monitoring key indicators at a ward level in between census years.

The objective of this challenge is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the % of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

South Africa is divided into over 4,000 wards.

We have aggregated the target indicator and the other predictive variables from the 2011 census across all the households within each ward to create an aggregated value of each indicator per ward.

For the purposes of this competition, the wards were splitted into a train and test set.

The model was trained on the 2,822 wards in the train set and model was applied to the 1,013 wards in the test set.

The model could be enhanced using GIS data provided by HERE Technologies.



## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The Root Mean Squared Error was used to evaluate accuracy of the submitted solutions.

## Prizes

1st Place: $2 500 USD

2nd Place: $1 500 USD

3rd Place: $1 000 USD

The competition was open to anyone based anywhere of any gender, however, cash prizes was awarded only to participants that are based in Africa (with a verified mailing address in Africa) and who are female(with an identification document that specifies gender).



## Benefits

This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as female household headship and income level in between census years.
