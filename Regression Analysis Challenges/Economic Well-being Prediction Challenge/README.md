# Competition Summary

## Description

Granular information on economic well-being is extremely useful for governments, policy makers, and NGOs.

But household surveys that capture this kind of information are expensive and conducted infrequently in many African countries.

The objective of this competition is to create a workaround for this lack of data by building a model able to predict a measure of wealth as measured in household surveys using readily available inputs.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

All of the datasets used cover the whole of Africa, meaning that any solution based on these can in theory be used to predict the wealth index for any country.

Layers sampled include measures of human settlement, land cover and nighttime light emissions, as well as two distance measures that often relate to economic success: distance to the country’s capital and distance to the ocean.

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a cluster of survey responses, and so the Target is a measure of the average wealth for a given cluster of respondents.

The target is a derived ‘wealth index’ based on responses in various household surveys.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Error.

## Prizes

2000 Zindi Points distributed to users who place on the leaderboard.


## Benefits

The Solutions could be useful for filling in the gaps between the more expensive surveys.
