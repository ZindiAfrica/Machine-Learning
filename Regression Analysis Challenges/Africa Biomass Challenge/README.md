# Competition Summary

## Description

Cocoa farming has driven massive deforestation in West Africa: Cote d’Ivoire, the world’s leading exporter, has seen a loss of 80% of its forests since its independence in 1960. While cocoa is traditionally grown in monoculture, it can thrive under the shade of tall trees. To restore some of the lost tree cover, the planting of shade trees is a high priority for the country as well as the private sector, to reverse the impacts of deforestation and improve carbon sequestration by African tropical forests.

In this challenge, your objective is to predict biomass in shaded regions in Cote d’Ivoire based on GEDI, Sentinel-2 and ground truth biomass data. Remote monitoring of the increase of biomass will help measure the impact of reforestation efforts in Cote d’Ivoire as well as detect degradation of forests due to cocoa, without requiring expensive and labor-intensive biomass estimates on the ground.


## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

You will be using earth observation data, GEDI and Sentinel-2. You can view a report on how the ground truth data was collected and combined for this challenge in the report in the download section.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

The error metric for this competition is the Root Mean Squared Error.

For every row in the dataset, submission files should contain 2 columns: Tile and Count.

## Prizes

1st Place: $5000 USD

2nd Place: $3000 USD

3rd Place: $2000 USD
