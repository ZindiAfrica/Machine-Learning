# Machine-Learning


## Overview

Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.

Machine learning programs can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. 

For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed.

For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.


## Definition	

Machine-Learning is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn or improve performance based on the data they consume.

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.
	
	
## History

The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.

A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.

Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"

 
## Types

Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories:

Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.

Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Semi-supervised learning  falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data).

Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

## Models

Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions.

Some models are:

Artificial neural networks, Regression analysis(Linear Regression and Logistic Regression), Decision trees, Support-vector machines, Bayesian networks, Genetic algorithms.


## Applications

There are many applications for machine learning, including:

Agriculture, Finance, Astronomy, Banking, Telecommunication, Adaptive Website, Marketing, Linguistics, Advertising and many more.
